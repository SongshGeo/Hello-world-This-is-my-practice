Record the processes of my study

Hi everyone!

Shuang Song here, a Ph.D in Beijing Normal University and my research interest is about Coupled Human and Nature Systems. My major is geography and history, I'm caring about how to explain the complex interactions between human & nature.

This repository will record processes of my study.
